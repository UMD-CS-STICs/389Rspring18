Ethics
======

## Assignment details

This assignment has two parts. It is due by 2/8 at 11:59 PM.
To submit your homework, please post your responses as either a public note **or** as a link
to your publicly available writeup on Piazza.


**If you do not submit a timestamped description, we will need you to resubmit for 5% off!**

### Part 1

Come up with a novel (meaning not discussed in class) ethical problem that's relevant in the
world of cybersecurity.

Explain why the problem is an *ethical* one, and present an ethical argument
for or against a course of action.

### Part 2

Consider the following situation:

You are a junior developer at a large automotive manufacturer, working in the
ECU ([Engine control unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_control_unit)) division.

Your job is to audit the ECU's firmware for security issues. After six months, you conclude: the
current ECU firmware has several complex security problems which, if made public, could
be exploited to both damage the car and endanger its occupants. You estimate that fixing these
problems will take another six months and a team of twenty developers.

Consider the ethical dimensions of this situation. For example:

* Who should you tell, if anybody?
    * Your boss, a consumer watchdog, the public? In what order?
* How far should you go, if at all?
    * What if your company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release?
* If you do nothing, are you responsible for any harm that results? Why or why not?

### Format

Both parts should be written in the same blog post, clearly separated. Full, grammatical sentences
should be used. Part 1 should be at least 300 words, and part 2 should be at least 200. There
is no penalty for going over these numbers, but there *is* a penalty for padding your work to meet
the minimums.

### Scoring

Part 1 is worth 70 points, and part 2 is worth 30.

### Tips

Reference the slides from lecture 2 on how to make a good ethical argument.

Observe that part 2 is the same as the second part of part 1: doing it first might stimulate your
thoughts.

Good luck!
